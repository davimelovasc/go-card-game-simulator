# Go Card Game Simulator

This project is a card game simulator implemented in the Go programming language. It serves as a study project to learn Go and is based on the course "Go: The Complete Developer's Guide" available on Udemy: [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide).

## Project Overview

The Go Card Game Simulator project involves creating a program that simulates a card game. It will include functionalities such as:

- Deck creation: Generating a deck of cards with suits and ranks.
- Shuffling: Randomly rearranging the cards in the deck.
- Dealing: Distributing the cards among players.
- Game logic: Implementing the rules and logic of the card game.
- Save and load state: Saving the current state of the game to a local file and loading it for future sessions.
